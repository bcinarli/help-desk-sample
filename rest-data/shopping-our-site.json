        "content": "<p>In order to give the best service possible, we recommend using a credit card with a credit line, your paypal account, or a debit card that is linked to a financial institution. While adidas.com is currently able to accept pre-paid cards, we recommend checking the terms of use for your card before committing to a purchase. Refunds on prepaid cards and removal of card authorizations can take up to 30 days to process. In addition, some cards are not reloadable, which will prevent us from being able to credit you if a return takes place. If you decide to utilize a pre-paid card to make a purchase, please retain the card until you receive your purchase. adidas.com may require proof of the card terms of use if we are unable to credit you. If we are unable to process a credit, and are able to verify that this is a non-reloadable card, we will issue an adidas.com digital gift card, usable on adidas.com and in adidas retail locations.</p>"
