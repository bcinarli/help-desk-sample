Making them personal means adding a personal name and number of your choice - your own, your pet's or well, basically anything (appropriate). Look for the Personalize It icon for availability.</p><p>To ensure your product looks its best, try to avoid the use of special characters â€“ some characters are not supported by the system.</p>"

This means that, when adding a pair of shoes to your bag with your name and/or number, your order will arrive 1 day later than usual.</p><p>Personalized and customized products are created just for you. That means we cannot accept returns, except for manufacturing defects. We recommend familiarizing yourself with fit of the specific model you are customizing.</p><p>Color varies between materials. Our site shows a very close representation of how your gear will look. However, because it is a digital representation, we expect there will be some variation between your screen and the product.</p><p>Orders are charged when they ship and do not require a signature for delivery. We begin the personalization process as soon as you place your order and are unable to make changes or cancel your order.</p>"
